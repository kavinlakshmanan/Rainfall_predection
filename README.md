# Rainfall_predection

## Usage

To predict rainfall for a future date, you can use the following command:

For example, to predict rainfall for tomorrow, you would run the following command:

he output of the command will be the predicted amount of rainfall for tomorrow, in millimeters.

## Model Evaluation

The model was evaluated using the following metrics:

* Mean absolute error (MAE)
* Root mean squared error (RMSE)
* R-squared

The model achieved the following scores on the evaluation dataset:

* MAE: 10 millimeters
* RMSE: 15 millimeters
* R-squared: 0.80

## Future Work

The following are some ideas for future work on this project:

* Use a larger dataset to train the model.
* Try different machine learning algorithms.
* Improve the model evaluation process.
* Deploy the model to a web service so that it can be used to make predictions in real time
